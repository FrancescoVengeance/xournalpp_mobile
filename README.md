# Try it out

***Mission completed:** We can now render strokes, images and text!. We thereby support the full `.xopp` file format.* :tada:

*Please note: stroke support is incredibly bad. There are lots of errors thrown.*

## Colors and Typography

### Colors

Our primary color is the Material DeepPurple. I simply prefer a colorful application over an old-fashioned gray GTK+ application.

The accent color is Material Pink.

`#e91e63` / `rgb(233, 30, 99)` / `CMYK(0%, 87%, 58%, 9%)`/ `hsl(340째, 81%, 51%)`

The light color is White.

`#ffffff` / `rgb(255, 255, 255)` / `CMYK(0%, 0%, 0%, 0%)`/ `hsl(0째, 0%, 100%)`

The dark color is Material Blue Grey 900.

`#263238` / `rgb(38, 50, 56)` / `CMYK(32%, 11%, 0%, 78%)`/ `hsl(200째, 19%, 18%)`
