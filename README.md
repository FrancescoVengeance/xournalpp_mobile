# <img src="assets/xournalpp-adaptive.png" width="64" style="height: auto;"/> Xournal++ - mobile edition (unofficial)

A port of the main features of Xournal++ to various Flutter platforms like Android, iOS and the Web.

# Try it out

***Update:** We can now render images and text!. You **won't see any
strokes** if you open a file but you **will see your images and texts**.* :tada:

This project is not yet ready for use. We are still implementing backend stuff like the handling of
the file format. As there is unfortunately [no full documentation](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/issues/2124)
of the `.xopp` format, you could describe this process als `try {...} catch (Exception e) {...}`.

Alternatively, you can download pre-build binaries for **Linux** and **Android** from the GitLab pipeline.

## Colors

Our primary color is the Material DeepPurple. I simply prefer a colorful application over an old-fashioned gray GTK+ application.

`#673ab7` / `rgb(103, 58, 183)` / `CMYK(44%, 68%, 0%, 28%)`, / `hsl(261Â°, 51%, 48%)`
